* Start tmux with the `tmux` command.

INFO: The "<prefix>" keyword will be used frequently, by default being the Ctrl+b combo (changed to Ctrl+Space).

NOTE: Tmux can have multiple sessions.

* To list all sessions and select one, execute `<prefix> s`.

* To rename current session, run `<prefix> $`.

* To create a new session, do `<prefix> :new`.

* To remove a session, either exit from all its windows, or `tmux list-sessions`, then `tmux kill-session -t <id>`.

NOTE: Each session can consist of several windows (of each one that can be active at a time). 

* To create a new window in the current session, run `<prefix> c`. It will automatically switch to the new window.

* You can switch between windows using `<prefix> <nb>`, where <nb> can be a number from 0 to 9 (maybe even higher?).

* You can also cycle between windows using `<prefix> n` (next) and `<prefix> p` (previous).

* You can kill the current window with the following: `<prefix> &`.

NOTE: Each window can contain multiple visible panes.

* To split the current pane horizontally, perform `<prefix> %`.

* To split the current pane vertically, perform `<prefix> "`.

* To switch between panes, combine the <prefix> with the arrow keys (e.g.: `<prefix> <-`).

* You can swap the active pane with one of the adjacent ones: `<prefix> {` and `<prefix> }`.

* Press `<prefix> q` to display the ID of each pane, then hit the digit key to select the desired pane.

* To zoom in or out on the current pane, use `<prefix> z`.

* To close a pane, either exit from its running shell or use `<prefix> x`.
